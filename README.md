# System-Analysis-and-Design
CS255 Portfolio

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the DriverPass client was a company designed to provide training resources for student drivers that would be kept up-to-date with current DMV guidelines. The system had to provide an online interface for customers and employees, and allow customers to purchase packages, schedule training sessions, and reserve vehicles and trainers.


What did you do particularly well?

I think I did particularly well in the overall system interactions and the functionality for each actor.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the system design document to be more specific and provide greater context for each function.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to understand a typical user's familiarity with using a computer system and design the system around a wide scope of use cases. That way, most users, no matter how diverse, will feel comfortable using the system.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Software should have a common "design language," with common variables and functions to provide the most versatility and serviceability. This benefits future developers in maintaining and expanding the software as needed. Along with this, providing detailed documentation will make all the difference.
